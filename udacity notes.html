<u><b>Inline & Block</b></u> - most html elements are defined as either block or inline.
<br>
<b>Inline</b> is anything "in the line" without any breaks

<br>
<br> The "br" tag inserts a single line break. It is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag. (I had to actually research how to insert the &lt;br&gt; tag into my note text without breaking the sentence as the break was intended to so.
